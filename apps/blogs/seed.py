dummy_blog = """In the past two decades, small studies
demonstrated that London taxi drivers tend to have an enlargement
in one area of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved with
developing spatial memory. Interestingly, that part of the brain is
one area that's commonly damaged by AD.These observations led to
speculation that taxi drivers might be less prone to AD than people
with jobs that don't require similar navigation and spatial processing skills.
A recent study explores this possibility by analyzing data from nearly nine
million people who died over a three-year period and had occupation information
on their death certificates. After accounting for age of death, researchers
tallied Alzheimer's-related death rates for more than 443 different jobs.
The results were dramatic."""
